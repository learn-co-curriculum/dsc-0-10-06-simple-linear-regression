    "Regression analysis is usually the first real \"learning\" algorithm that aspiring data scientists will come across. It is one of the simplest algorithms to master, however,  still requires some mathematical and statistical understanding of the underlying regression process. This lesson will introduce you to regression process based on the statistical ideas we have discovered so far. \n",

    "## Objectives\n",

    "\n",
    "* Describe statistical modeling with simple regression \n",
    "* Explain simple linear regression analysis as solving for straight line equation: $y=mx+c$\n",
    "* Calculate the slope and y-intercept given a set of data points\n",
    "* Calculate a regression line based on calculated slope and intercept\n",

    "So far, we have covered topics like basic hypothesis testing using z-scores, variable relationships with correlation and covariance etc. In this section, we shall further build upon these ideas to explain the process of regression analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regression analysis is one of the most important statistical techniques for business applications. It’s a statistical methodology that helps estimate the strength and direction of the relationship between two (or more variables). Regression results show whether this relationship is valid or not. It also also, helps __predict__ an unknown value based on the derived relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Regression Analysis is a __parametric__ technique used to **predict** the value of an unknown target variable $Y$ based on one or more of known input features as variable $X$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The factor that is being predicted (the factor that the equation solves for) is called the __dependent variable__. The factors that are used to predict the value of the dependent variable are called the __independent variables__.\n",
    " For example, height of a human being and his foot size are generally correlated variables as seen in the scatter plot below. Taller persons, by in large tend to have a bigger foot/shoe size.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"hf.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear regression analyses can predict foot size (dependent variable), given height (independent variable) of an individual. Regression is proven to give credible results if the data follows standard parametric assumptions like normality, linearity etc. These will be covered in upcoming lessons in detail. In general, regression analysis helps us in data analytics in following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finding an association, relationship between variables.\n",
    "* Identifying which variables contribute more towards the outcomes.\n",
    "* **Prediction** of future observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it called \"linear\" regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in previous lesson, the term **Linear** implies that the model functions along a straight (or nearly straight) line. **Linearity**, one of the assumptions of this approach, suggests that the relationship between dependent and independent variable can be expressed in a straight line. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple Linear Regression** uses a single feature (the independent variable) to model a linear relationship with a target (the dependent variable) by fitting an optimal model (i.e. the best straight line) to describe this relationship.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple Linear Regression**, which we shall look into detail in the following section, uses more than one features to predict a target variable by fitting a best linear relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we shall mainly focus on simple regression to build a sound understanding. For the example shown above i.e. height vs foot size , a simple linear regression model would fit a line to the data points as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"hf2.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "This line can then be used to describe the data and conduct further experiments using this fitted model. So let's move on and see how to calculate such a line in a simple linear regression context "
